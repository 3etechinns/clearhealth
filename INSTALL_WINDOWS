Installation should be straigtforward on windows system but the mysql command must be in the system path.

You can add it to the path by selecting the appropriate checkbox when using the XAMPP installer or manually:
	* Open 'My Computer'->Properties->Advanced->'Environment Variables'->'System Variables Section'->Path. If mysql is installed in the default location, the mysql path should be "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0\bin"
