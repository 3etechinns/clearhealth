Before updating, back up all existing data.

This upgrade process assumes two separate databases: one containing
the old install, and an empty one for the new.

Setup:
Before upgrading, please prepare the new ClearHealth directory with all
necessary modules and edit config files for using the new database.

To upgrade your old install, edit config.php here, along with the upgrade.sh
script, adding the database information.

Now simply run:
sh ./upgrade.sh from this directory.
