Importing data into ClearHealth is a two step process. 
Use the squeeze scripts to get the data from your current system,
then use the inject scripts to enter the data into ClearHealth. If
you are lucky ClearHealth will already have import scripts listed in the 
/local/setup/import directory. If you are not lucky then you will have to 
code one from scratch.


To write a parser for your current system, you might start with one of the already 
written scripts. It will show you the format of the data file...
It needs to import data into a php file. The php file should 
contain a large associative array.

Then you need to use the import scripts under the common directory
to import your data. You may need to modify these to get the system to work. 

There is a map table that will automatically be created in ClearHealth by
the import scripts. This will contain the map of ids in the previous system
to the ids in ClearHealth. Using this is is possible to make certain
that data is not imported twice.
