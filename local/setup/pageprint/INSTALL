To Compile you need:

Mozilla-devel
Gtk+2-devel
Glib2-devel
libxml2-devel


To run you'll want xvfb install and running
The scripts directory has some scripts for starting xvfb and taking screenshots of it

You can configure things by copying PagePrint.xml to /etc/PagePrint.xml and editing the file

If your making webpage snapshots make sure your making a big enough xvfb.  If you try to take a 1024x768 shot on 800x600 Xvfb you'll get odd results.

To install just cd to src, run make then make install

The packaging sucks at the moment but it will get better

Requirements:
PHP 4.3.9+ (Used in the PagePrint wrapper)
Gecko (tested against Mozilla-1.7.13)
Xvfb (by default we use display :10, look in scripts/runXvfb)
