This is a quick guide to installing ClearHealth and FreeB2

clearhealth and freeb2 must be installed in parallel directories. For simplicity they share a directory called clear in the tarball for this reason. clear should be placed in a directory published by Apache with php rights. Google for LAMP installation or visit the Apache and PHP website for more information on how to do this.

   1. edit clear/clearhealth/local/config.php with the SQL variables you want to use
   2. create the database with the same name used in config.php, usually clearhealth
   3. load clear/clearhealthlocal/setup/install.sql into the clearhealth db
   4. configure the clear/freeb2/local/config.php to point to the freeb2 and clearhealth sql databases
   5. create the database with the same name used in the freeb2 config.php, usually freeb2
   6. load local/setup/freeb2.sql into the freeb2 db
   7. both freeb2 and clearhealth directorys have a tmp subdirectory, these subdirectories must be configured so that the webserver can write to it, either by changing its permissions to 777 or changing the ownership to the apache user
