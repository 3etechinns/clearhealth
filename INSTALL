The installation of clearhealth is now accomplished through a graphical installer.

Untar the clearhealth tgz file into your web directory and rename it to "clearhealth". Then point your browser to the clearhealth directory. The installer will check your dependancies, what directory permissions need to be changed, create the configuration files and install the database.
