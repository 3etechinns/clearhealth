This is a quick guide to installing ClearHealth and FreeB2

The tar ball contains on directory, called "clearhealth". This should be placed in a directory published by Apache with php rights. Google for LAMP installation or visit the Apache and PHP website for more information on how to do this.

Generally the ClearHealth project will support the latest versions of Fedora/RHEL and Ubuntu/Debian, but otherwise if you want to run ClearHealth, please download the XAMPP project. This will give you versions of php/mysql/apache that the project can support more easily. 

   1. edit clearhealth/local/config.php with the SQL variables you want to use
   2. create the database with the same name used in config.php, usually clearhealth
   3. load clearhealth/local/setup/install.sql into the clearhealth db
   4. configure the clearhealth/freeb2/local/config.php to point to the freeb2 and clearhealth sql databases
   5. create the database with the same name used in the freeb2 config.php, usually freeb2
   6. load freeb2/local/setup/freeb2.sql into the freeb2 db
   7. clearhealth/tmp and clearhealth/freeb2/tmp must be configured so that the webserver can write to them, either by changing its permissions to 777 or changing the ownership to the apache user
   8. change memory_limit in the php.ini file to 64
   9. change max_execution_time in php.ini to 45
  10. change register_globals in php.ini to off
  11. change magic_quotes_gpc in php.ini to off
  12. restart httpd server
