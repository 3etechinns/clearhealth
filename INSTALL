The installation of clearhealth is much simpler now to the installer.

All you have to do is untar the clearhealth tgz file into a php/apache web directory 
and then point your browser to the clearhealth directory. The installer will check your dependancies,
tell you what directory permissions need to change and then create the configuration files and install the 
database.
