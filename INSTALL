This is a quick guide to installing ClearHealth and FreeB2

clearhealth and freeb2 must be installed in parallel directories. For simplicity they share a directory called clear in the tarball for this reason. clear should be placed in a directory published by Apache with php rights. Google for LAMP installation or visit the Apache and PHP website for more information on how to do this.

   1. edit clear/clearhealth/local/config.php with the SQL variables you want to use
   2. create the database with the same name used in config.php, usually clearhealth
   3. load clear/clearhealthlocal/setup/install.sql into the clearhealth db
   4. configure the clear/freeb2/local/config.php to point to the freeb2 and clearhealth sql databases
   5. create the database with the same name used in the freeb2 config.php, usually freeb2
   6. load local/setup/freeb2.sql into the freeb2 db
   7. both freeb2 and clearhealth directorys have a tmp subdirectory, these subdirectories must be configured so that the webserver can write to it, either by changing its permissions to 777 or changing the ownership to the apache user
   8. change memory_limit in the php.ini file to 64
   9. change max_execution_time in php.ini to 45 
  10. change register_globals in php.ini to off
  11. change magic_quotes_gpc in php.ini to off
  12. restart httpd server
